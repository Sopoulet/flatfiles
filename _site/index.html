    <h3>Jurassicipsum 1</h3>
    <p><h1 id="article-jurassic-ipsum-1">Article Jurassic ipsum 1</h1>

<p>A snake slithers across a tree branch, past what looks like the large iris of a flower. The flower blinks. It’s the eye of the raptor. Muldoon sees it. He raises his gun. Instead of running away again, the raptor rises slowly out of the brush, fully revealing itself to Muldoon, hissing at him. The corners of Muldoon’s mouth twitch up into a smile. He draws a bead on the animal. His finger tenses on the trigger. Suddenly, his smile vanishes, both eyes pop open, and a terrible thought sweeps across his face. His eyes flick to the side “Clever girl”</p>

<p>“Dr. Grant, my dear Dr. Sattler. Welcome to Jurassic Park.” They turn and look at the view again. It’s beautiful vista, reminiscent of an African plain. A whole herd of dinosaurs crosses the plain, maybe a hundred that we see in a quick glance alone. “Ellie, they’re absolutely - - they’re moving in herds. They do move in herds!” “We were right!” “How did you do it?! How did you do this?!”</p>

<p>You’re implying that a group composed entirely of female animals will… breed? Dr. Ian Malcolm: No, I’m, I’m simply saying that life, uh… finds a way.</p>

<p>You know the first attraction I ever built when I came down south from Scotland? It was a Flea Circus, Petticoat Lane. Really quite wonderful. We had a wee trapeze, and ah, a merry-go - -a carousel - - and a seesaw. They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas. “I see the fleas, mummy! Can’t you see the fleas?” Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade… But with this place, I wanted to show them something that wasn’t an illusion, something that was real, something they could see and touch. An aim not devoid of merit.</p>

<p>We can make it if we run. No, we can’t. Why not? Because we are being hunted. Oh God. In the bushes straight ahead. It’s all right. Like hell it is!</p>
